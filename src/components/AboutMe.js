      <p><span>I have always wanted to use my brain in a job.</span> Retail has never been mentally demanding, even in the management positions I have done. I am a naturally curious person and love problem solving and expanding my brain. Programming taps into all of those and more, or so far that I have seen with my experience. So, I joined Epicodus to further my knowledge and get the skills I need to be a Developer. Also, the education on diversity and career searching are not a bad side benifit!</p>
